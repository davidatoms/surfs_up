# Surfs Up
This project is meant to analyze trends around the climate in Hawaii for our client who would like to open up a surf shop. They'd like to know the temperature data for the months of June and December on the island of Oahu.

## Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
| - | June Temp Stats |
| - | ----------------------------------- |
| count | 1700 |
| mean  |~ 74.94 |
| standard dev  | 3.26 |
| min  | 64 |
| 25%  | 73 |
| 50%  | 75 |
| 75%  | 77 |
| max  | 85 |

The table is pretty self-explanatory. For the 1700 days we analyzed from historical data in the month of June on the island of Oahu, the average temperature was around 75 degrees. With the standard deviation at 3.26 degrees, this means that the temperature did not vary much, and if it did, it was an anomoly. 

## Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
| - | December Temp Stats |
| - | ----------------------------------- |
| count | 1517 |
| mean  |~ 71.04 |
| standard dev  | 3.7 |
| min  | 56 |
| 25%  | 69 |
| 50%  | 71 |
| 75%  | 74 |
| max  | 83 |

The temperature in December is not much different from June, but it does cool off by a few degrees. The fluctuation is also greater in December than in June with some days still reaching close to the Summer temperatures. 

## Statistical Analysis:
The average temperatures between the two months change. The month of December is around one standard deviation cooler than in the month of June. The highs are close to the same temperature. I feel that the feeling of the air would also have more to do with the consumer's willingness to buy ice cream and surf. If the temperature is more cloudy or more sunny, I'd like to see how that impacts consumers' willingness to purchase ice cream. 

I also believe that the location of the surf/ice cream shop is imperative to its success. If the surf shop is in a place with bigger waves, I wonder how likely the ice cream would sell compared to if it were by a beach for tourists. There was a beach by my old house in El Granada that looked over the Mavericks big wave surf spot. There were a lot of surfers out there in these months, but there weren't as many ice cream shops as I saw in Santa Cruz on the boardwalk.

## Further Thought and Potential Analysis:

There is a possible competitor or friend to help with production called Dave's Hawaiian Ice Cream. The HQ building for this ice cream hub is located on Oahu and has the capacity to produce 50,000 gallons of ice cream per month (https://www.daveshawaiianicecream.com/made-in-hawaii/). I believe that if we cannot make our own ice cream, we should sell Dave's Famous Ice Cream, as long as the flavors are popular and tasty. 

According to FineDiningLovers.com, the top ice-cream consuming cities are:
1. Long Beach, California
2. Dallas, Texas
3. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
4. Columbus, Ohio
5. Milwaukee, Wisconsin
6. Fort Worth, Texas
7. Washington DC
8. Bakersfield, California
9. Fresno, California
10. Portland, Oregon.

With more time and study, I could use the same model for Surfs Up on the data from these cities and other states around the country to figure out which is closest to Oahu in terms of temperature for the months of June and December.

Furthermore, I found in some secondary research that Alaska consumes the most ice cream per capita (https://www.thealaskalife.com/blog/delicious-dessert/#:~:text=While%20the%20results%20across%20the,place%20ice%2Dcream%20consumption%20trophy). It is not known to be a very hot state. It would take further looking into to see if the data from the two months on Oahu compares with the ice cream consumption in Alaska and if the data can be used to simulate financial profits.
